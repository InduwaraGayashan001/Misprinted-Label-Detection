# Misprinted Label Detection

This project aims to develop an automated system for detecting misprints on product packaging. By utilizing YOLOv8 for object detection and integrating with Arduino for automated responses, the system identifies and handles packaging errors efficiently.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Leveraging YOLOv8 for accurate detection of misprints.
- **Automated Response**: Integration with a PCB to manage errors in real-time.
- **Efficiency**: Swift identification and correction of packaging issues.
